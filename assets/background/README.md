# Background generating
The original wallpaper was made by [Liam Bunston from Simple Desktops](http://simpledesktops.com/browse/desktops/2014/apr/04/floppydsk/). However I wanted different colors and more space between each floppy, so I recreated the floppy by hand and wrote a small scripts that generates a bunch of them.

## Changing the looks
The amount of floppys/rotation/colors/etc can be changed, however I do not feel like keeping track of the settings in two places, so just look at `settings.py`.

## Generating the background
Just run:
```bash
python generate.py
```

and you should have an svg and jpg.
